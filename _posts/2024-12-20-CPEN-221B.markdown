description: Computer Engineering 221B is an introduction to software engineering. The course provided covered abstraction and writing solid specifications as well as the importance and basics of testing. During the course I had to work with a team to build a project of our choosing. We chose to make an automatic scheduling app that fills blanks in your timetable. My role was primarily to make the UI, but I also handled the data abstraction.
